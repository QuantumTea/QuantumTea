# Why "QuantumTea"? 

### My first love was physics, and I'm English-American (a naturalised US citizen), so my blood group is tea. Hot, black tea with milk (sweetener optional depending on stress level)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data science with a Master's degree at [Maryville University](https://www.maryville.edu/)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a karate black belt

Languages are Java and C# to JavaScript, R, and Python, with a little Elixir for fun.
